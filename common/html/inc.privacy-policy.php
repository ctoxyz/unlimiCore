<font size=4 color=white><b>Our Privacy Commitment to You</b></font>
<br><br>
UNLIMICORE&trade; (UNLIMICORE) UNLIMICORE&trade; will not knowingly give, sell, rent, or loan any personal information to any third party without your expressed permission. We employ the best technology available, coupled with our commitment to protecting your privacy.
<br><br><br><br>



<font size=4 color=white><b>Our Information Security Practices</b></font>
<br><br>
We employ only the latest available Internet security systems to protect your personal data from any unauthorized use. We store all confidential information in <b>256-bit encrypted</b> form inside our secure databases. We take technical, contractual and administrative steps to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of information within our control. 
<br><br>
We ensure that our employees are aware of our security policies and practices at time of hire and through periodic company-wide email reminders. All employees are required to sign strict confidentiality agreements upon hire. Only selected employees have access to our databases, and may do so only upon entering a double password protected access system. 
<br><br>
<font size=4 color=#ff8400><b><center>** PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURITY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO US **</center></b></font><br>When you enter sensitive information (such as Your Sign-Up, Your Credit Card Number, and Your Profile) on Selected Forms that information is encrypted using <font color=#fff600><b>Professional Grade Extended Validation (EV) Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 256-bit technology </font></b> while in transit across the Internet, and selected data is encrypted via <font color=#ff8400>256-bit AES</font> for storage.</h1>  In lay terms, we go above and beyond to ensure we never run into a problem with your information.  If we see your information it is heavily encrypted, if "they" (the internet) sees it, it's heavy encrypted (not-viewable), and our Partners Only See it when they have the Proper Authentication (An Extraordinarily Lengthy Authetication Pass-phrase).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
